## Set of Podman and Singularity definition files to build container images

> Singularity is a container solution created for scientific and application driven workloads. Singularity containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you donâ€™t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a Singularity container and run.

> Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System.

Both container engines support the reusage of docker images.

### Singularity

When using singularity as runtime, be sure to have created and set predefined folders for building and pulling:

```
[create these folders]


export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=${HOME}/.singularity/tmp
export SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR=${HOME}/.singularity/local_cache
```

#### keras + tensorflow

1. Move to the definiton file (`definiton.def`) folder:

`cd ml_keras_tf`

2. Build the image:

`singularity build --fakeroot ml_keras_tf.sif definition.def`

3. Once it's ready, run the container:

*Example: running container with default runscript (in this case jupyter notebook)*

`singularity run --nv  ml_keras_tf.sif

*Example: running container with a custom command*

`singularity exec --nv ml_keras_tf.sif jupyter notebook --no-browser`

> NOTE: By default singularity binds the directories `$HOME`, `/tmp`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/dev`. So that you can modify the files wher your permissions (as user) apply.

*Example: running a command from inside the container --in shell mode--*

`singularity shell --nv --bind data:/data ml_keras_tf.sif`
`jupyter notebook --no-browser`

This will open a shell inside the container. Additionally, we can add extra bindings using `--bind`. In this example, the folder `data` in our current working directory is bind to the folder `/data` in the containers file system.

### Modifying the container image

You can do so by: mounting the container in `sandbox` mode and rebuilding once it is ready; using the `writable` mode; or by modifying the `definition.def` file and rebuilding the image.
